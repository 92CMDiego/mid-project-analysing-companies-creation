    "##### 1. Motivation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea of this exercise is to analyse a dataset that contains the number of new LLC's created per country per year. The analysis covers the period from 2006 to 2020 and includes data for 163 countries. We would like to:\n",
    "- See if we can relate this figures to some other variables.\n",
    "- Obtain insights about the data and the possible relationships.\n"

    "\n",
    "The files with the raw files and the code used for preparation are in the folder 'Datasets preparation'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process was done separately for each dataset, as the original files come from different sources and the format is different.\n",
    "- The datasets are formatted so that each row represents the register of a year for an individual country.\n",
    "- A column with the iso code of the country (alpha3) is introduced. We used pycountry library for this.\n",
    "- An \"id\" column is introduced to uniquely identify each row. It is formed by the combination of the country code and the year of the register (for example: \"ESP-2006\").\n",
    "\n",
    "As the datasets contain historical information and cover large lists of countries, all of the files contained missing data (represented with nan values). The majority of these values are not replaced nor this rows eliminated (we keep most of the information of the source). We do remove some other 'nan' values during the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We find the largest amount of nan values in the following columns of the Economic freedom index dataset (this is due to the fact that these metrics were not computed until 2017):\n",
    "- Judicial Effectiveness (and therefore the category to which this metric belongs, Rule of Law). Rule of Law category is added later in the file 'main' (we dind't have this column in the data from the source).\n",
    "- Fiscal Health (and therefore the category to which this metric belongs, Government Size). Government size category is added later in the file 'main' (we dind't have this column in the data from the source). \n",
    "\n",
    "All of these tables are transferred to a MySQL Workbench schema (named nbc)."
